# Distance-Measurment-System

Implementation of a distance measurement system that measures the distance using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 with the specifications listed below: 

1. Use ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz. 
2. Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. 
3. The LCD should display the distance value like that: 
4. The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture model.
